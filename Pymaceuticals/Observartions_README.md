# Look across all previously generated figures and tables and write at least three observations or inferences that can be made from the data.
# Include these observations at the top of notebook.

**Observations**

1. At the first timepoint (timepoint = 0), every tumor starts with a volume of 45 mm3, before being applying the selected drugs, so according to
a boxplot analysis that we create by extracting the Lower Quartiles, Mid Quartiles, Upper Quartiles, IQR, Lower Bounds,	Upper Bounds and Outliners
of 4 drugs of interest (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin), we can confirm that there are only to successful treatments that showed a
decrease in the initial tumor volume (45 mm3), this two drugs where Capomulin and Ramicane, both start with 45 mm3 of tumor volume, and average a
final tumor volume of: Capomulin - 38.13 and Ramicane - 36.56. We are certain that the most effective drug to decrease the tumor volume is Ramicane.
In the other hand Infubinol and Ceftamin, didn't reach the expected outcome, because in both of them the final average of tumor volume was above 45 mm3.

- Ramicane Initial Tumor: 45 mm3
- Capomulin Initial Tumor: 45 mm3
- Ceftamin Initial Tumor: 45 mm3
- Infubinol Initial Tumor: 45 mm3

- Ramicane Average Initial Tumor: 36.56 mm3
- Capomulin Average Initial Tumor: 38.13 mm3
- Ceftamin Average Initial Tumor: 59.85 mm3
- Infubinol Average Initial Tumor: 60.17 mm3

2. In Capomulin Cases, according to a Scatter Plot Graph the tumor volume of a mice is strongly correlated to the weight of it,
with a r-squared of 0.903, and actually it makes sense, because the bigger the tumor is, the heavier the mouse will get.


3. Making sense with the point number one, we can appreciate in a bar chart that the two drugs that are more applied to mice, are Capomulin and Ramicane, and will all justification both are the ones with the most promising results.
